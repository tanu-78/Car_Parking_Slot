# Car_Parking_Slot
The Remote Car Parking Slot project combines the power of Node MCU, IR Sensor, Servo Motor, and Adafruit IO to create a smart and accessible car parking platform that can be controlled and monitored remotely from anywhere in the world. This project aims to provide convenience and efficiency in managing car parking spaces while leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

Key Components
Node MCU: Node MCU is an open-source IoT platform based on the ESP8266 microcontroller. It serves as the brain of the project, connecting the hardware components to the internet and enabling remote control and monitoring.

IR Sensor: An Infrared (IR) sensor is used to detect the presence of a car in the parking slot. It detects the infrared radiation emitted by the car and triggers the system to take appropriate actions.

Servo Motor: A servo motor is responsible for controlling the movement of the parking slot barrier. It rotates to open or close the parking slot based on the received commands from the Node MCU.

Adafruit IO: Adafruit IO is a cloud-based IoT platform that provides easy integration and communication between connected devices and the internet. It enables real-time data exchange, remote control, and monitoring capabilities for the car parking slot.

Key Features
Remote Control: The car parking slot can be controlled remotely from anywhere in the world using the Adafruit IO platform. Users can use a mobile app or a web interface to open or close the parking slot barrier.

Real-time Monitoring: The status of the parking slot (occupied or vacant) can be monitored in real-time through the Adafruit IO platform. Users can receive instant notifications or check the status at any time to determine the availability of the parking slot.

Automatic Barrier Control: The IR sensor detects the presence of a car and triggers the servo motor to open the parking slot barrier automatically. When the car leaves, the IR sensor detects the absence and closes the barrier, making the parking slot available for the next car.

Data Logging and Analytics: The system records and logs the parking slot's occupancy status over time. This data can be used for analysis, such as identifying peak hours, average occupancy rates, or generating insights for future improvements.
